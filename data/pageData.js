        "Mindventure Hikes truly began in 2023 with our first charity hike for the Turkey Earthquakes in February 2023. Our goal was to raise funds for those impacted by the disaster. What started as a single event quickly grew into something much bigger. The positive response from participants inspired us to organise more hikes and before we knew it, a vibrant community had formed. People from all walks of life came together, united by a shared love for nature, adventure and giving back."
